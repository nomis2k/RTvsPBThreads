INTRODUCTION
============

    Performance measurement of the large set of data writen/read in/from files
    using:

        - ROOT TTree
            http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TTree.html

        - Google ProtoBuf
            http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/



PROCEDURE
=========

    The same number of files is generated in both cases with same amount of
    random data. Data are written to output in one or the other format.

    ROOT framework (root.cern.ch) does not work in multi-threaded application
    and therefore reading of ROOT files is done in sequential mode (1-by-1).

    Google ProtoBuf may analyze files either in sequential or multi-threaded
    mode.



TASK
====

    The aim of this project is to measure the performance of data reading
    procedure in a number of setups:

        1. sequential ROOT vs sequential Google ProtoBuf

        2. sequential ROOT vs multi-threaded Google ProtoBuf
